  Description: "The Bakunawa is a huge shark that has wings and is believed to devour
    the sun or moon.\r\n\r\nIt has a body of a large shark and gills of a big fish.
    Its jaw was said to be as large as a lake with reddish tongue and coarse whiskers.
    On its\u2019 sides are two large wings.\r\n\r\nThe Bakunawa lives in the deepest
    part of the ocean and would sometimes fly to the sky and devour the sun or moon
    which would darken the world. People became frightened when it happened and made
    lots of noise. The noise was heard by the Bakunawa and made it scared that it
    released the sun or moon."
